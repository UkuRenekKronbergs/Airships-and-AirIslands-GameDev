## 🎮 Game Summary
_Airships and AirIslands_ is a roguelike-inspired strategy game where the player commands a flying fortress — a ship that is both home and weapon.  
The game blends **FTL-style node exploration** with **Fallout Shelter–like building mechanics**, while adding crew needs, trade, and survival elements.  

Key inspirations: **FTL**, **Fallout Shelter**, **Sunless Sea**, **Oxygen Not Included**, **Rimworld**.

## 🌀 Core Gameplay Loop
1. Travel between floating islands (nodes)  
2. Encounter **battles, events, or trade opportunities**  
3. Manage crew needs (food, rest, morale)  
4. Upgrade ship rooms and systems  
5. Survive until the **final boss**

## 🗺️ World & Progression
- **One sector** per run, made up of:  
  - **Handmade nodes** (cities, villages, unique locations)  
  - **Randomized nodes** (battles, events, empty space)  
- Node contents **refresh every X days** → world feels alive

## ⚙️ Resources
- **Fuel** – required for movement

## 🏗️ Ship & Rooms
Ships are modular, made of **rooms**:  
- **Mandatory rooms** (engine, pilot, weapons, etc.)  
- **Optional rooms** (cargo hold, bedrooms, mess hall, medbay, etc.)  

Players must balance **limited space**:
